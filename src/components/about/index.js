                <p>Fascinated by all things technology, I love understanding how parts within a computer work, how systems talk to each other, and how people engage with them. This has led me to pursue a career in web development where I can apply my creative problem solving skills to connect people and solve problems through accessible and responsively designed websites.</p>
